Unit Tests:

1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

    expect the inputs and outputs to be numbers
    expect the output to come out when two inputs are put in
    expect the function to multiply the inputs and outputs accordingly
    expect the function the take multi-numbered inputs 
    expect an error when a input other than a number is put in
    expect an error when the inputs are excessively long numbers
    expect an error when the inputs are n ot put in correctly
    expect an error when something other than a number is also included with a number in the input
    expect an error when a fraction is put in
    expect an error when a decimal is put in

2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

    expect the function to take in both arrays and sort them accordinly
    expect the fuction to return the sorted numbers in an array
    expect the array to include whole numbers
    expect the function to take in whole numbers
    expect the function to return one number if there are multiples
    expect an error when something other than a whole number is in any array
    expect an error when the array/s are not entered correctly
    expect an error when a decimal is put in an array
    expect an error when a fraction is put in the array
    expect an error if the function is coded wrong

Functional Tests:

1. A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.

    the user clicks the checkout button and is shown three buttons with guest, create account, and log in
    when the user clicks guest they are brought to the screen to put in their info
    when the user finishes putting in their info after clicking guest, they are asked again if they want to create an account or log in, if they dont click it, it brings them to the screen to finsh their order, if they click create account then it takes them to the create account screen, if they click log in it takes them to the log in screen
    when the user clicks create account, it brings them to a screen to put in the info to create an account
    once the user creates an account, it brings them back to the screen to finish their order
    when the user clicks log in it brings them to the screen to put in their info to log in
    if the user puts in wrong info them it will tell them worng email or password
    if the user puts in the right info then it beings them back to the screen to finish their order
